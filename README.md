# Muffin Cupcake Scone Classifier

For this project, I have built classification models to predict if a recipe is making cupcakes, muffins or scones. The features used to predict these outcomes are flour and sugar. I used support a vector machine and decision trees models and compared the accuracy across all to build the best classification model.
